Of course, it's not that THE JUDGEMENT DAY that I mentioned here. But for me, it is truly one.
<!--more-->
I had my most difficult courses ever since I started my learning phase from primary school. I felt so helpless when reading the notes of the course. Even with the solutions to the tutorials, I still have difficulties understanding.

I was so nervous that I couldn't sleep until the dawn of the next day. Lying on the bed, nightmares of the imaginary exam papers and the terrible results occurs over and over again, image by image. How could I do? I tried, and I really did my best to understand this course, and truly, I began to know what this course is teaching. Abstract as it may be, I used the whole 'RAM' of my brain to decipher the codes.

Now, it's over. At 7 pm last night, this exam finally finished. Not good though, but it was really a relief for me. I would like to take a rest and prep the best me for the left two courses.

All of a sudden, I find that I'm just like Dr. John Watson, the friend of Sherlock Holmes, like to use blogs to record my daily life. My writing is not that interesting as what he wrote, of course. All I'm doing to remind myself that once I had this life before in case that I forgot in the future.
