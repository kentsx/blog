I did one 'brave' thing. Tested the rules of Singtel prepaid card. In fact, I did similar thing at the end of the first month. Here, let me explain some rules of prepaid card.

Your account will be divided into many parts, main account, bonus, data.
Bonus account usually comes after you buy the bonus packages or top up some money into main account.

Real money, here by I mean money from bank card or paid at AXS or SAM, etc. will be stored into main account.

Money in main account can be used to buy bonus packages or data etc.
**KEY FINDINGS: The best deal I think to use data is this way.**
* Buy a 1GB best value @ $7, valid for 7 days
* At the last day of validation, buy 10MB @ $1 (if you still have a lot of data left) or buy another 1GB @ $7. This will extend the expiration date and the data will be accumulated.

Today I also find, if you buy four 10MBs together, like I did this afternoon, then the expiration day will extend directly 28 days instead of 7 days. The maximum is four, the fifth cannot be done.

This is what I find today, share with everyone. If any mistake or misunderstanding, leave comments, and I will reply ASAP.
