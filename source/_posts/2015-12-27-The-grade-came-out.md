It was 8 am still, on 22nd December. Quite early in the morning. And for me, even earlier.
<!--more-->
Last night, I went to Clark Quay with a friend of university, who was in Singapore for a competition.

As is known, Clark Quay is the place for drinking. We drank for a lot last night, and almost missed the last MRT. Fortunately, we both caught it.

But, thatmorning was special enough. Because the final exam grade would come out. And because of subscription of SMS notification, I received the grade exactly 8 am.

I was woken up by the vibration of my wristband, still feeling dizzy a bit. "What's up? It's quite weird that I receive SMS such early." the though in my mind.,"MUST BE SOME WRONG INFO." But habitably, I still grabbed the mobile phone and clicked the power button. "WHAT THE F**K!" I almost shouted out. How could the SMS comes so early, with me having the sweet dream!! I trembled, hesitating whether to open the message.

Should I? What if the result is horrible? I have no confidence for the final exam, especially, having the ST5214, the nightmare.

Alright, finally, I still chose to open the message. Closing my eyes and praying for not a horrible result. Maybe my prayers were heard by certain god, when I open my eyes, looking at the screen, I was full of amazingness. The score was pretty good, much much better than I expected. OMG, I even could not use words to express my happiness.
